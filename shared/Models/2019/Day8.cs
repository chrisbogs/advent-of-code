        //The Elves' spirits are lifted when they realize you have an opportunity to reboot one of their Mars rovers,
        //and so they are curious if you would spend a brief sojourn on Mars. You land your ship near the rover.
        //When you reach the rover, you discover that it's already in the process of rebooting!
        //It's just waiting for someone to enter a BIOS password.
        //The Elf responsible for the rover takes a picture of the password (your puzzle input) and sends it to you via the Digital Sending Network.
        //Unfortunately, images sent via the Digital Sending Network aren't encoded with any normal encoding;
        //instead, they're encoded in a special Space Image Format.None of the Elves seem to remember why this is the case.
        //They send you the instructions to decode it.
        //Images are sent as a series of digits that each represent the color of a single pixel.
        //The digits fill each row of the image left-to-right, then move downward to the next row,
        //filling rows top-to-bottom until every pixel of the image is filled.
        //Each image actually consists of a series of identically-sized layers that are filled in this way.
        //So, the first digit corresponds to the top-left pixel of the first layer,
        //the second digit corresponds to the pixel to the right of that on the same layer,
        //and so on until the last digit, which corresponds to the bottom-right pixel of the last layer.

        //For example, given an image 3 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall, the image data 123456789012 corresponds to the following image layers:
        //Layer 1: 123
        //         456
